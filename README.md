A scooter rental app needs to be created, the admin enters information about the scooters, such as its charge, location, cost per minute, 
ID (if random) and can book a scooter using the user ID. 
If he uses it, there should also be a stop feature to count how much money he has. 
The time you rent it should be kept on file and calculated by subtracting it from the parking time.
